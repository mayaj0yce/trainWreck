As a user I want an application that will allow me to create a new logo in just a few steps.

This is done through the command line with 'node index'.

Testing for circle, square, and triangle shapes. 


I ran into a few issues when doing this project, including issues with testing, formatting, and recording.
I was able to get a TA's help and was able to understand that you have to directly tell tests what attributes to look for.
Viewing the SVG logo was a simple and stupid mistake that I finally understood (open with live server).
Recording a walkthrough was not something I had yet done and a quick google search helped.
